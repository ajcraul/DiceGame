This is Allie's Decision Dice-Roll website.

When I or a friend cannot make a decision because we are millennials, we will use pseudo-randomization to help us make these decisions.

This will be the first website I have attempted to make all by myself with the help and study of "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" by instructor Angela Yu of The App Brewery, as well as Udemy, and the Denver Public Library.

Thanks for reading and using this website. Please feel free to use my contact to report and bugs or with any comments or feedback!
